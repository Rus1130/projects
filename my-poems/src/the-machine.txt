[sleep][sleep]After a long day's work, I finally return to my home. My desk.[newline]
The machine stares at me. Blankly. I boot it up.[newline]
I have been working on a certain program for a while now.[newline]
As the machine boots up, I look around my room. There is a spider in the corner. I'd have to catch it later.[linebreak]
It makes that familiar sound, the sound it always makes when it turns on. I run my program.[newline]
"6" appears on the screen. All is well. I run my program again.[newline]
"66". As it should. This is expected.[newline]
I run it again. "666". Wonderful.[linebreak]
Again. "6 666". Excellent.[newline]
/Again./ "66 666". /Perfect/.[newline]
*/Again!/* "666 666".[linebreak]
[sleep][sleep].[sleep][sleep].[sleep][sleep].[linebreak]
[sleep]No. This is wrong. I run it again.[linebreak]
"6 666 666".[linebreak]
No. It is still wrong. Why? Why is it wrong? Did I make a mistake?[newline]
I run it a final time.[linebreak]
[speed1]66 666 666[speeddefault][linebreak]
[sleep][sleep]It is correct.[linebreak]
I had forgotten. It is always wrong those two times. Why was I worried?[newline]
I sigh, close the program, and shut down the machine.[newline]
I see the spider. It's still in the corner. Why? Why is it still there? I should have caught it earlier.[newline]
I catch it in a red cup, and I bring it outside and release it, let it wander free.[newline]
I return into my room. I sit at my desk. The machine is off.[linebreak][sleep][sleep]
"Carrot"[linebreak][sleep][sleep]
That word fills my mind. I am not sure why. I am scared. Confused. Petrified.[linebreak]
I look at the machine. It is off. It is silent. It is still.[linebreak]
The day passes, and night falls. I am tired. I go to bed.[linebreak]
As I stare into the darkness of my room, I see a faint light coming from the direction of my desk.[linebreak]
I get up, and I walk to it. The machine is on.[linebreak]
The screen glows a faint white, from where it says:[linebreak]
[sleep][speed2]"What is your favorite vegetable?"[speeddefault][linebreak][sleep][sleep][typewriter-complete]
