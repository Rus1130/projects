/We stole the sun from the sky,[newline]
to spite the gods that abandoned us.[newline]
We power our machines[linebreak]
with the blood of a million flies.[linebreak]
And when the sun opens its eyes,[newline]
it will see the great Mechanicus,[newline]
and wonder why./[linebreak][sleep 700][function]
