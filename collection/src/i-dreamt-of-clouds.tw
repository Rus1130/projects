I once saw a cloud shaped like a dinosaur.[newline]
Like the chicken nuggets my mother would make for me when I was younger, a Brachiosaurus.[newline]
I saw a cloud shaped like a firetruck, a kite,[linebreak]

Then I saw clouds shaped like Switzerland,[newline]
others shaped like Czechoslovakia.[linebreak]

But now I only see clouds.[linebreak][sleep 700][function]
