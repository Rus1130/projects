Ever since the [color 255 60 60]/fire/[resetcolor], I've been[speed 1][newline]
[speeddefault]missing a part of me. It's[speed 1][newline]
[speeddefault]like there's a hole inside of me.[newline]
One could say, there's a "[invert]void[invert]".[linebreak]
[sleep 800]a void sounds like "avoid", which is[speed 1][newline]
[speeddefault]how [sleep 200][speed 80]/they/[speeddefault][sleep 200] treated me after the fact,[newline]
saying I caused the fire. I didn't. I swear.

[speed 1]\*\*\*[speeddefault][sleep 1000]
[linebreak]
Or did I? I don't remember.[linebreak]
I can't remember. I don't remember /how/ to remember.[newline]
That entire day was a blur to me. A[speed 1][newline]
[speeddefault]void. It's like the time between falling asleep and[speed 1][newline]
[speeddefault]waking up. Nothingness. Who am I talking to? What am I talking to? Who are you?
[linebreak]
[speed 1]\*\*\*[speeddefault][sleep 1000]
[linebreak]
Oh, right. The fire. The fire that[speed 1][newline]
[speeddefault]left a [invert]void[invert] inside of me.[newline]
Burned it inside of me. That[speed 1][newline]
[speeddefault]was the day the [invert]void[invert] taught[speed 1][newline]
[speeddefault]me the cruelty of the world.[newline]
The world is a cruel place.[newline]
It is a crude place, but[speed 1][newline]
[speeddefault]there is nothing I can do except stand up, and move forward, away from the fire.

[sleep 1000][speed 70 0]And so he stood up,[sleep 500] gasoline can in hand,[sleep 500] and walked away.[linebreak][sleep 700][function]
