Before I write this poem, my cat was sitting next to me[speed1][newline]
[speeddefault]as I read the book assigned to me[speed1][newline]
[speeddefault]by my teacher.[newline]
My teacher is a smart man, /a smart man,/ who[speed1][newline]
[speeddefault]treats us like the adults we are. Or claim to be.[newline]
I felt him (my cat) purring as I scratched his head.[newline]
He is a black cat. With a bit of white.[newline]
Tuxedo they're called.[newline][newline][function]
