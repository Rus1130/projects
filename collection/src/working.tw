"two hundred million dollars" the Mailman said to me,
the disillusionment you feel when the federal government
comes to Your house and take the dollars
that I worked my ass off to get.
my money, _my money, it is my money_

isers. Mailman, a Harvard-trained lawyer,previously led the Independent Women’sLaw Center, arguing in court that bio-logically male athletes who identified astransgender had undermined legal pro-tections for female athletes. (“May Mail-man is my Taylor Swift,” Riley Gaines, aswimmer who became a prominent activ-ist after competing against Thomas, wroteon X in February.) Mailman told me thatthe Administration’s critique of higher edhas roughly three parts. The first is thatmany of these institutions are too rich todeserve endless public largesse. “We havea thirty-six-plus-trillion-dollar nationaldebt, and American taxpayers are pay-ing billions to élite universities with ex-tremely generous endowments,” she said.The second is that universities are failingin their basic mission. Instead of produc-ing citizens who will “propel our coun-try into the next generation of greatness,”they are, in her view, creating “indebtedstudents with useless majors who hateour country and like to go to riots.” Thethird is that the so-called woke aspectsof campus culture—D.E.I., transgenderathletes, unchecked antisemitism—vio-late federal laws.Over the past nine months, the Ad-ministration has waged an effective, un-relenting assault on higher education.D.E.I. programs have been dismantlednationwide. Columbia will pay more thantwo hundred million dollars to settle al-legations of antisemitism and violationsof antidiscrimination laws.The N.C.A.A.ruled that athletes “assigned male at birthmay not compete on a women’s team.”This campaign has been framed byTrump officials as existential. Max Eden,a former Domestic Policy Council stafferwho wrote a brief outlining how to “de-stroy Columbia University,” published aSubstack post likening the second TrumpAdministration to the Battle of Agin-court, in which an outnumbered EnglishArmy crushed the French. The Admin-istration has also pledged to abolish theDepartment of Education altogether—along-held goal among conservative ac-tivists, who believe education should bemanaged locally. “They can’t repeal thedepartment,” James Kvaal, Biden’s Under-Secretary of Education, told me. “Sothey’re vandalizing it.”A decade ago, higher education was“an away game for Republicans,” RickHess, a senior fellow at A.E.I., said. Thathas changed. “The Trump Administra-tion’s very aggressive moves against Co-lumbia and Harvard in 2025 would havebeen unthinkable in 2017,” Eitel, the for-mer Education Department official, toldme. As Trump’s assault on higher ed hasunfolded, conservatives have learned tostop worrying and love federal power.“For so long, conservatives were, like, ‘Wecan get there by hoping,’” Mailman said.“ ‘We’ll write some op-eds. We’re goingto be nice to people.’”That approach hasfailed, she said. This Trump Adminis-tration marks a new era. “You don’t feellike a bunch of losers anymore,” Mailmantold me. “You have a seat at the table.”The Department of Education build-ing is ugly in a distinctly Washing-ton way—a concrete shoebox more sug-gestive of bureaucratic toil than of anygrand vision of government. Directly infront of it stands a memorial to DwightEisenhower, which includes a metal tap-estry of the Normandy cliffs, where Ei-senhower oversaw troops on D Day.When Eisenhower, a Republican, waselected President in 1952, the memory ofWorld War Two and the pressures of theCold War shaped every aspect of poli-tics, including education. He champi-oned the National Defense EducationAct and poured federal money into uni-versities to advance weaponry and spacetechnology. Eisenhower’s investmentsbuilt on a long history; in the nineteenthcentury, the U.S. government had cre-ated numerous land-grant universities,which became the backbone of Ameri-ca’s public-university system. There wasa compact between the federal govern-ment and higher ed: taxpayers wouldfund research and student aid. In return,universities would deliver scientific break-throughs and educate citizens who coulddefend the nation.This compact was broadly popular.Conservatives groused about ideology—in the nineteen-fifties, the public intel-lectual William F. Buckley, Jr., blastedYale as dogmatically secular; in the eight-ies, the political philosopher Allan Bloomdecried relativism—but the consensusheld. “The general feeling about Amer-ican higher education was that it was thefinest in the world,” Margaret Spellings,who served as George W. Bush’s Edu-cation Secretary, told me. “People camefrom all over the world to study here. Itwas a major driver of our economy. Schol-ars and academics were widely respected.”Republican reformers worked within thatconsensus: Spellings convened a com-mission to push for greater affordabilityand accountability, asking colleges to pro-vide better data on things like studentoutcomes and employment, but “the uni-versity community was, like, ‘Hell no—give us our money and leave us alone,’ ”Spellings recalled. “It does make me won-der if we had read the room and rungthe bell back then, whether that wouldhave prevented some of this cynicism.”Around this time, a political scientistnamed Jonathan Pidluzny was launch-ing his academic career. Universities, hetold me, are “where young people areempowered to live good lives—to think,to write, to appreciate beauty.” Theseschools ought to drive the economy, bol-ster national defense, and serve as “re-positories of our civilizational inheritance.”All this, he said, has been “imperilled bythe woke takeover of higher education.”In January, Pidluzny joined the De-partment of Education, becoming thedeputy chief of staff for strategy and im-plementation. He came from the Amer-ica First Policy Institute, a conservativethink tank, where he argued that D.E.I.was fuelling antisemitism and the spreadof “transgender ideology.” In his writ-ing, he urged concessions from univer-sities accused of enabling antisemitism,including an audit of D.E.I. offices andacademic programs that allegedly pro-mote “anti-Israel bias.” He called for thegovernment to revoke visas of studentssuspected of supporting Hamas and topenalize universities that failed to dis-close large foreign gifts, which violatesfederal law and arguably exposes schoolsto ideological influence. Under Trump,much of this has become policy. “Howdid I get to where I am?” Pidluzny said.“It’s watching something really valuableto our way of life slip away.”Pidluzny’s perspective reflected thebroader conservative mood: disillusion-ment with the cultural dogmas of theleft, fused with populist anger towardélite hoarding of wealth and influence.His cultural critiques were unmistakablyright-wing, but his scorn for the corpo-ratization of universities might havecome from the mouth of a disaffectedleftist. “With very few exceptions, uni-versities are or aspire to be hedge funds, welded to multinational corporations,welded to think tanks,” he said at a 2022conference. “They teach a few coursesto keep tax-exempt status.”In January, Trump signed an execu-tive order pledging to fight antisemitismon campuses, citing instances when Jew-ish students had been physically threat-ened and blocked from libraries and class-rooms. The D.O.J. soon assembled a taskforce. Pidluzny joined, as did officialsfrom Health and Human Services, whichcontrols much of the nation’s scientific-research funding. Josh Gruenbaum, aninvestor who grew up in an OrthodoxJewish household and had been tappedto run the Federal Acquisition Service—the government’s clearing house forgoods, services, and contracts—was in-vited to join, too. “I was literally sittingin the delivery room right after my sonwas born, and this executive order camedown,” he recalled. “The galaxy is tell-ing you, ‘This is a moment.’ ”One key to combatting campus an-tisemitism, Gruenbaum believed, lay inthe billions of dollars’ worth of federalcontracts that the government has withuniversities. “The way we need to bethinking about these things is: we aremaking an investment,” Gruenbaum said.“It is a privilege to do business with thefederal government.” Every contract re-quires compliance with federal law, in-cluding Title VI of the Civil Rights Actof 1964, which bars discrimination basedon race, color, or national origin in fed-erally funded programs. The theory be-hind the task force was simple: formalcivil-rights investigations are slow, butagencies could quickly freeze or cancelfunds on the ground that the schoolshad violated their federal contracts, forc-ing universities to try and cut a deal.The task force met at least once aweek and reported developments to Mail-man, the White House point person.The schools it targeted had some of themost visible conflicts after October 7th:Columbia and Harvard, along with peerinstitutions such as Brown, Cornell, andNorthwestern. “All of higher ed takes itscues from the élite institutions,” Pidluznytold me. “They’re also the places where thealleged violations of law have been mostsignificant.” When schools were targetedfor investigation, multiple agencies wouldissue press releases or letters in quicksuccession, creating the effect of a striketeam. Veterans of past Administrationswere astonished. “I remember how dif-ficult it was to get cross-agency coöper-ation on anything when I was in theObama and Clinton Administrations,”Bob Shireman, a senior fellow at the Cen-tury Foundation, told me. The fact thatit’s happening now, he said, suggests thatthere’s “muscle from the White House.”The Administration also scrutinizedschools for things like offering race-specific scholarships and for charging in-state tuition to undocumented students,arguing that these benefits disadvantageAmerican students. Mailman called it a“whole-of-government” strategy. “It’s onething to go give some speeches,” she said.“It’s another thing to actually say outloud that we, the federal government, areno longer sponsoring, promoting, or sup-porting wokeism.” Mailman even claimedthat some universities were grateful forthe political cover to course-correct: “Fi-nally, now, there’s almost an excuse—they can just act normally.”Meanwhile, the Department of Gov-ernment Efficiency was recommendingcuts to federal grants and contracts, oftentargeting proposals with progressive-sounding keywords. Many of these cutswere to scientific research, somethingthat, for decades, both parties had treatedas sacrosanct, steadily boosting funds forthe National Institutes of Health andthe National Science Foundation. Notso under Trump. He proposed a forty-per-cent cut to the N.I.H. budget and acap on the reimbursement rate for indi-rect costs, which includes spending onthings like equipment and maintenance.The Administration has also targetedscience funding at the schools under in-vestigation, largely by freezing grants.Pidluzny pushed back on the notion thatthis is a crackdown on the scientific en-terprise; the Administration has simplyrecognized that science funding is themost valuable leverage it has. Schools“need to understand that the conse-quences would be real,” he said. “Éliteinstitutions tend to be responsive to twothings: prestige and money.”Gruenbaum made a claim that I heardfrom numerous other Trump officials:if the endangered research is truly vital,universities can figure out other waysto fund it, such as donor dollars. PennyGordon-Larsen, the vice-chancellorfor research at the University of NorthCarolina-Chapel Hill, was less optimis-tic, arguing that companies are “market-driven” and unlikely to “sink money” intouniversity research that might take de-cades to pay off. Lon Cardon, who runsa biomedical-research institution calledthe Jackson Laboratory, noted that eventhe richest companies and foundationscannot replace federal science spending.“It is absolutely impossible to fund thescale of basic research needed in thiscountry or anywhere” with just philan-thropic and private funds, he said.
